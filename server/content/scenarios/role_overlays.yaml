      "Design a recommendation system for 10 million users. You have 2 GPUs and 3 weeks."
      The constraints are the test. Anyone can dream big with infinite resources.
      Can you build smart with nothing?

      Your first dashboard. The exec team will see it Monday.
      One wrong number and you'll be explaining yourself in a room full of people
      who don't know what a LEFT JOIN is but definitely know when revenue looks wrong.

      Your first pipeline. Ingesting data from a legacy system that was built
      before you were in college. The documentation is a 3-year-old Confluence page
      with a dead link and the note "ask Rajesh (he left)."

      Your first model. The training data has 47 features and nobody can explain
      what half of them mean. Feature engineering isn't glamorous, but it's where
      the real work happens.

      Your first deployment. The model works in the notebook. Getting it to work
      in production is an entirely different war. Latency, memory, versioning —
      the gap between demo and real is where ML engineers earn their scars.

      The dashboard shows revenue declining. Your manager wants you to "adjust the timeframe"
      to make it look like growth. "It's just framing," they say.
      But you know: the board will make decisions based on what you show them.

      You discovered PII in the analytics pipeline. Social security numbers in plain text.
      The fix is simple. The question is: do you report it or quietly patch it?
      One makes you the hero. The other means explaining why nobody caught it sooner.

      Your model has bias. Not subtle bias — the kind that denies loans
      to certain zip codes at twice the rate. The business loves the accuracy number.
      The accuracy number doesn't know about fairness.

      The content moderation model is flagging minority language patterns as toxic
      at 4x the rate. The accuracy metrics look great — on the majority dataset.
      Your manager wants to ship Friday. The bias fix would take two more sprints.
